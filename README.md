# Question Papers Dataset

## Introduction
Welcome to the Question Papers Dataset repository! This dataset has been compiled from various online sources, consisting of model question papers spanning across different undergraduate subjects. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of GenAI-based models for generating question papers, catering to educational purposes exclusively. These include aiding students with exam preparations and recommending professors and question paper setters with quality questions for tests.

## Dataset Structure
The question papers are meticulously organized into separate folders, each representing a distinct undergraduate subject. The naming convention for files in these folders follows the pattern:

_**YYYY_K_id.pdf**_

Where:
- `YYYY` represents the year of the question paper.
- `K` denotes any identifier common for each source from which the question paper originated.
- `id` signifies a unique identifier, potentially distinguishing papers within the same year or course.

## Dataset Size
At its current state, the dataset is relatively small. However, efforts will be made to continually expand and refine it over time through the collection and processing of additional question papers.

## Citation and Sources
It's essential to acknowledge and credit the sources from which the question papers have been obtained. This dataset wouldn't be possible without the contribution of various online platforms and educational institutions. While specific sources may not be listed here due to the nature of aggregation from diverse sources, we express our gratitude to all the contributors who have made this dataset possible.
